# codeceptjs-native-POC
This project is a proof of concept implementation of using codeceptJS for testing native apps on android and iOS using Appium.

CodeceptJS (https://codecept.io/) is a platform agnostic testing framework that can automate testing against web, hybrid, and mobile apps.
It can execute tests against simulators, against real devices, and through cloud based device providers such as SauceLabs, Browserstack, and Perfecto.

## Getting Started

Before installing, you need to have node installed on your system.  For macs, this can be most easily accomplished using homebrew.  If you don't have homebrew installed on your system, you may do so by pasting this into terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
